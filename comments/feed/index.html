		<description><![CDATA[I am out of the &quot;SASS vs LESS&quot; discussion, since if it was me, we&#039;d still be using &lt;table/&gt; everywhere.

I&#039;m a software engineer, not a designer ;)

Anyway, I supporting this project since &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic&quot; title=&quot;Assetic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Assetic&lt;/a&gt; is much much better and fits better to my needs.

SASS is already supported in Assetic if you want to use it!]]></description>
