		<description><![CDATA[I am out of the &quot;SASS vs LESS&quot; discussion, since if it was me, we&#039;d still be using &lt;table/&gt; everywhere.

I&#039;m a software engineer, not a designer ;)

Anyway, I supporting this project since &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic&quot; title=&quot;Assetic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Assetic&lt;/a&gt; is much much better and fits better to my needs.

SASS is already supported in Assetic if you want to use it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Robert,
I wouldn&#039;t suggest to use this for commercial projects as it comes shipped with no unit tests and is actually a hack for minify.
If you need to support commercial projects which need some stability, I&#039;d consider using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic&quot; title=&quot;Assetic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Assetic&lt;/a&gt;, which is tested and works like a charm in my Zend Framework 2 modules :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure if this fixes the problem for everyone in every browser, but simply replacing the header() call at line 314 in min/lib/Minify.php like this fixed it for me:

&lt;code&gt;
if($name == &quot;Content-Type&quot; &amp;&amp; stristr($val, &quot;text/less&quot;)) {
   header($name . &#039;: &#039; . &quot;text/css&quot;);
} else {
   header($name . &#039;: &#039; . $val);
}
&lt;/code&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I decided to stop working on this Minify LESS CSS integration as I&#039;m really busy working on Zend Framework 2, Doctrine 2 and Assetic (which is a PHP 5.3 minify killer) and studying/making slides for my company... Even in my free time. Sorry...
As said, the repository is still on github and I&#039;ll be pleased to accept any pull requests from anyone :)]]></description>
