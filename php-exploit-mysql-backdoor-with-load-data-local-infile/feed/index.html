		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for pointing it out... That shows yet another leak/exploit I did not think of when using MySQL.
Also, I have to warn users that these bugs are not only related to the LAMP stack, but to MySQL itself.
I forgot to tell that in the article as I was focusing on the &quot;standard&quot; environment I work on every day.
The problems with any FILE statement affect EVERY MySQL server, especially if it&#039;s access is provided outside localhost.
This is a problem with MySQL itself. If you didn&#039;t fix it and you&#039;re not the only person to have access to your system: go fix it NOW!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Things can even get worse. &quot;LOAD DATA INFILE&quot; requires the FILE privilege. That same privilege also controls &quot;SELECT INTO OUTFILE&quot; which let&#039;s you write selected data to files. Through a combination of SQL-injection and careless setting of filepermissions, you might be able to select a literal string containing a php/shell script and write it to a file in the webroot. That would be an exploit that allows a hacker to execute arbitrary code on your server. Therefore my advice would be to disable FILE privileges on MySQL used on a webserver. If you still think you need &#039;m, think twice. If after that you still need them, create a special MySQL user and grant FILE permissions to that user only. Also make sure that your webservers webroot is read-only.]]></description>
